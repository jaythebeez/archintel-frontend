# ArchIntel

This is the frontend for the Archintel assessment and it is written with react, typescript and sass.

## Installation

Use yarn or nom to install all dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Workflow

This application has two authentication pages a login page and a registration page.

After authentication the user can see his/her dashboard and add, edit or publish articles.


## Shortcomings

This is were I am very honestðŸ˜…. The application slightly differs from what was in the requirements. I didn't really understand the full workflow of the application mainly why there are companies were they supposed to be added by the editor and selected by the writer(I really don't know). But apart from that I also created a login system cause it made more sense to me and was a pre-defined workflow.
 

## Improvements
I could make some of the designs much better especially the tables and lists but in my defence I was really focused on making sure the app logic was working. I could also add more user feedback

## Summary
I really enjoyed working on this although I feel it took too long as an interview project except if you were testing to see if people could actually finish the job too. If I had the chance I could have used Firebase and Material UI and finished the job in about 2 days. But your testing criterias mentioned css and api integration.
